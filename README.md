# Description
Fight with the cybernetic hordes and restore the connection to the real world in this isometric retro-style cyberspace shooter. Can you beat them?


# Controls
Use arrowkeys to control the character. Use X to shoot and Z to use the shield (further in the game).
You can also use any standard controller (PS3/PS4/XBox) - I have tested PS3 controller clone and NES controller clone and they work great!
